In Part D of this week's workshop we will define
a boundary map `H0 G C â†’+ H1 H A` coming from a short
exact sequence of `G`-modules. In this definition we make
a choice of sign ("do we use `g b - b` or `b - g b`?"). 
The final boss of this course
is verifying the first seven terms of the long exact sequence
of group cohomology associated to a short exact sequence of
G-modules.
